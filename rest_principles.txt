Principles of Rest Services:
	Uniform Interface:
		In REST, everything is a resource. Resource may be a document, picture, video, module, class, method, etc. Anything that is available to service consumer. 
		Resources are accessed using URI.
		Each resource must have unique URI.
		SAME URI but DIFFERENT HTTP methods

	Statelessness:
		no client state information is maintained at server
		hence, scalable and reduced work load
		
	Layered System:
		example, API in one server, Database in another server, authentication in another server	

	Code on Demand:
		different format based on demand. XML or JSON
